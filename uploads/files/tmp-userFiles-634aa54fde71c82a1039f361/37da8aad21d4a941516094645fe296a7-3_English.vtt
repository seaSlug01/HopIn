00:00:10.511 --> 00:00:12.930
I don't know, man.
I mean, I'm kind of sad.

2
00:00:13.097 --> 00:00:15.057
Them towers be home to me.

3
00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:17.852
You gonna cry over a housing project now?

4
00:00:17.935 --> 00:00:21.022
Man, they should have blew
the motherfuckers up a long time ago.

5
00:00:21.105 --> 00:00:22.940
Man, it ain't all been bad.

6
00:00:23.024 --> 00:00:27.069
I mean, I done seen some shit happen up
in them towers that still make me smile.

7
00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:31.157
A few moments from now,
the Franklin terrace towers behind me,

8
00:00:31.657 --> 00:00:36.412
which, sadly, came to represent some
of this city's most entrenched problems,

9
00:00:36.495 --> 00:00:37.496
will be gone.

10
00:00:37.788 --> 00:00:41.125
Y'all talking about steel and concrete,
steel and fucking concrete.

11
00:00:41.209 --> 00:00:44.712
Man, I'm talking about people,
memories and shit.

12
00:00:44.795 --> 00:00:47.215
That ain't the same.
They gonna tear this building down.

13
00:00:47.298 --> 00:00:48.591
They gonna build new shit.

14
00:00:48.674 --> 00:00:49.717
But people?

15
00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:51.240
They don't give a fuck about people.

16
00:00:51.636 --> 00:00:54.222
You are very soon going to see

17
00:00:54.305 --> 00:00:58.351
low and moderately priced
houses built in their place.

18
00:00:58.434 --> 00:00:59.644
Yeah!

19
00:00:59.977 --> 00:01:01.520
My cousin used to live in 221.

20
00:01:01.604 --> 00:01:03.124
I used to be up in there all the time.

21
00:01:03.189 --> 00:01:05.691
Man, who you be telling?
I caught my first pussy up in there.

22
00:01:06.192 --> 00:01:07.193
The girl, chantay.

23
00:01:07.818 --> 00:01:09.362
Man, why didn't you say?

24
00:01:09.445 --> 00:01:11.381
They probably wouldn't be
tearing this tower down now.

25
00:01:11.405 --> 00:01:13.407
They could put a big-ass sign in the front.

26
00:01:13.491 --> 00:01:16.994
"Here's where Malik carr
first got his dick wet."

27
00:01:17.161 --> 00:01:19.640
We could be taking pictures.
Tourists be taking pictures and shit.

28
00:01:19.664 --> 00:01:23.167
- Souvenirs of your dick.
- He ain't funny. Hejustjealous.

29
00:01:23.251 --> 00:01:24.502
What? Jealous of that?

30
00:01:24.585 --> 00:01:25.795
You crazy? Chantay?

31
00:01:25.878 --> 00:01:28.089
Man, the mention of that bitch
make my dick burn.

32
00:01:28.172 --> 00:01:29.715
Yo, ain't no bad pussy, fool.

33
00:01:29.799 --> 00:01:32.110
Yeah, that's what they keep telling
your ass down at the clinic.

34
00:01:32.134 --> 00:01:33.135
Keep that shit up.

35
00:01:33.219 --> 00:01:36.055
You ever see this motherfucker
walking down to the clinic burnt?

36
00:01:36.138 --> 00:01:38.641
Poot be like this.
He looks like a backwards-ass cowboy

37
00:01:38.724 --> 00:01:40.893
standing like this and walking like this.

38
00:01:40.977 --> 00:01:44.855
- Dick looking like a fried chicken wing.
- Now, mistakes have been made,

39
00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:47.775
and we will learn from those mistakes.

40
00:01:47.858 --> 00:01:51.612
Reform is not just a watchword
with my administration, uh-uh.

41
00:01:51.696 --> 00:01:53.256
- No, it's a philosophy.
- Yeah!

42
00:01:53.364 --> 00:01:55.658
Shit, no matter how many times
you get burnt, man,

43
00:01:55.741 --> 00:01:57.785
you just keep on doing the same.

44
00:01:57.868 --> 00:01:59.412
Nigger do not learn.

45
00:02:00.705 --> 00:02:02.790
Now, what do you say? Mm?

46
00:02:02.873 --> 00:02:05.167
Are you ready for a new Baltimore?

47
00:02:05.418 --> 00:02:07.336
Shit gonna be off the hook, yo.

48
00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:09.755
Man, my whole life been around them towers.

49
00:02:10.089 --> 00:02:14.135
I mean, I feel... shit, I feel like
I don't got no home no more.

50
00:02:14.218 --> 00:02:17.805
Housing just moved your mama
up to poplar grove, didn't it?

51
00:02:17.888 --> 00:02:20.057
You ain't homeless, nigger, you got a home.

52
00:02:20.141 --> 00:02:22.226
You just damn near out of work is all.

53
00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:23.477
What you mean?

54
00:02:23.686 --> 00:02:25.747
I mean, look. All over the city,
even out in the county,

55
00:02:25.771 --> 00:02:28.649
you had people, coke or dope, 24/7.

56
00:02:28.733 --> 00:02:30.443
Where was it they go?

57
00:02:32.278 --> 00:02:34.214
Man, look, you live in the projects,
you ain't shit.

58
00:02:34.238 --> 00:02:36.657
But you sling product there?

59
00:02:36.741 --> 00:02:39.035
You got the game by the ass, man.

60
00:02:40.703 --> 00:02:42.747
Now these downtown
suit-wearing-ass bitches

61
00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:45.416
snatched the best territory
in the city from y'all.

62
00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:47.752
You wanna cry over
some shit, cry over that.

63
00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:50.629
All right, everyone. Count with me.

64
00:02:51.964 --> 00:02:54.300
Ten, nine,

65
00:02:55.176 --> 00:02:57.470
eight, seven,

66
00:02:57.636 --> 00:03:00.389
six, five,

67
00:03:00.598 --> 00:03:02.641
four, three,

68
00:03:02.933 --> 00:03:05.353
two, one!

69
00:03:17.823 --> 00:03:19.450
Ooh!

70
00:03:20.076 --> 00:03:22.995
Hallelujah! About time.

71
00:03:24.622 --> 00:03:27.792
Yeah!

72
00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:29.418
Oh, shit.

73
00:03:54.860 --> 00:03:57.154
When you walk through the garden

74
00:03:58.781 --> 00:04:01.117
you gotta watch your back

75
00:04:02.576 --> 00:04:05.037
well, I beg your pardon

76
00:04:06.038 --> 00:04:08.165
walk the straight and narrow track

77
00:04:08.374 --> 00:04:10.000
walk the straight and narrow track

78
00:04:10.126 --> 00:04:13.003
if you walk with Jesus

79
00:04:13.838 --> 00:04:15.923
he's gonna save your soul

80
00:04:17.550 --> 00:04:21.303
you gotta keep the devil

81
00:04:21.554 --> 00:04:24.849
way down in the hole

82
00:04:25.516 --> 00:04:27.726
he got fire and the fury

83
00:04:27.893 --> 00:04:29.520
fire and fury

84
00:04:29.687 --> 00:04:32.189
at his command

85
00:04:33.274 --> 00:04:36.527
well, you don't have to worry

86
00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:39.989
hold on to Jesus' hands

87
00:04:40.197 --> 00:04:43.367
oh, we'll be safe from Satan

88
00:04:43.826 --> 00:04:46.454
when the thunder rolls

89
00:04:47.913 --> 00:04:51.333
you gotta keep the devil

90
00:04:51.917 --> 00:04:55.171
way down in the hole

91
00:05:03.137 --> 00:05:06.348
You gotta keep the devil

92
00:05:07.016 --> 00:05:09.268
way down in the hole

93
00:05:13.063 --> 00:05:14.398
way down

94
00:05:14.482 --> 00:05:17.735
way down in the hole

95
00:05:28.245 --> 00:05:30.998
Fuck! I just stepped in dog shit.

96
00:05:32.166 --> 00:05:33.667
You hope.

97
00:05:35.127 --> 00:05:36.420
Fuck.

98
00:05:46.305 --> 00:05:48.065
I want them to love me
like they love 'pac...

99
00:05:48.140 --> 00:05:50.309
Cheese? Can you see him?

100
00:05:51.227 --> 00:05:53.854
When the plan is to put the rap game
in a choke hold

101
00:05:53.938 --> 00:05:56.524
I'm fully focused, man,
my money on my mind

102
00:05:56.607 --> 00:05:58.687
got a meal out the deal
and I'm still on the grind...

103
00:05:58.984 --> 00:06:01.070
- Yo, where he at?
- Who you mean?

104
00:06:01.153 --> 00:06:03.113
Cheese, man. I'm looking for cheese, man.

105
00:06:03.197 --> 00:06:05.991
Nigger, you ain't supposed to be
dropping names and shit.

106
00:06:06.075 --> 00:06:07.576
Ain't you got no sense?

107
00:06:07.660 --> 00:06:11.260
I ain't said shit about shit, man. I'm
just looking to get together with the man.

108
00:06:11.330 --> 00:06:15.543
- To see him about nothing at all.
- So he be where he be, fool.

109
00:06:15.626 --> 00:06:17.145
Is he at the
place that we was at?

110
00:06:17.169 --> 00:06:18.712
I'm looking to saddle up

111
00:06:18.796 --> 00:06:20.673
and put another bat on this motherfucker.

112
00:06:20.756 --> 00:06:23.716
He need to deal with me today or I'll
take it to someone who can handle it.

113
00:06:24.718 --> 00:06:25.761
All right.

114
00:06:25.844 --> 00:06:29.557
"Saddle up and put another bat
on the motherfucker"?

115
00:06:29.974 --> 00:06:32.309
Settle up and put another bet.

116
00:06:34.144 --> 00:06:35.646
But what was that last part?

117
00:06:35.729 --> 00:06:38.315
Man said, "he need to deal with me today,

118
00:06:38.399 --> 00:06:42.653
- "or I'll take it to someone who can handle it."
- Girl, you do have an ear.

119
00:06:49.827 --> 00:06:51.036
And I ain't changed

120
00:06:51.120 --> 00:06:52.880
you should love it,
way more than you hate it

121
00:06:52.955 --> 00:06:54.999
oh, you mad, I thought that you'd be happy
I made...

122
00:06:55.332 --> 00:06:56.917
He's looking to get with him.

123
00:06:57.001 --> 00:06:59.044
- All right.
- Same thing as before?

124
00:06:59.128 --> 00:07:01.505
- Same thing I told him.
- All right.

125
00:07:01.922 --> 00:07:03.716
Pumping in the club it's on

126
00:07:03.799 --> 00:07:06.594
I wink my eye at ya bitch
if she smiles she gone

127
00:07:06.677 --> 00:07:09.263
if the roof on fire, let
that motherfucker burn

128
00:07:09.346 --> 00:07:11.807
if you're talking about money, homie,
I ain't concerned

129
00:07:11.890 --> 00:07:14.935
I'm-a tell you what banks told me
cos go 'head switch the style up

130
00:07:15.019 --> 00:07:17.619
if niggers hate them let them hate
then watch the money pile up...

131
00:07:19.732 --> 00:07:20.733
What are you seeing?

132
00:07:21.066 --> 00:07:22.943
Call comes in to cheese's number two.

133
00:07:23.360 --> 00:07:25.279
He whispers in the
man's ear and off they go.

134
00:07:25.738 --> 00:07:28.866
- Yeah. Nothing to the call here.
- I figured that.

135
00:07:31.827 --> 00:07:34.204
These guys come correct.

136
00:07:34.288 --> 00:07:35.956
The phones only go so far.

137
00:07:36.040 --> 00:07:39.335
Above that,
it's all done as a face-to-face meet.

138
00:07:43.881 --> 00:07:47.134
Three months and we've
yet to hear his voice.

139
00:07:50.137 --> 00:07:53.307
And herc takes the alley
to cut that off from Calhoun.

140
00:07:53.390 --> 00:07:55.851
Me and truck go up the wrong way
on stricker street?

141
00:07:56.226 --> 00:07:57.978
You got a badge, remember?

142
00:07:58.062 --> 00:08:01.732
We're doing the same one block over,
so they can't come to ground there neither.

143
00:08:02.358 --> 00:08:05.119
When we jump out on these cocksuckers
there'll be a designated runner.

144
00:08:05.277 --> 00:08:07.696
Who's gonna sky up,
just so we chase his ass.

145
00:08:07.988 --> 00:08:12.409
But fuck him. We let him go and Jack
every other motherfucker who stays.

146
00:08:12.493 --> 00:08:14.495
Let's mount up.

147
00:08:17.081 --> 00:08:18.916
Carv.

148
00:08:20.709 --> 00:08:22.753
What's up?

149
00:08:25.673 --> 00:08:27.257
He's a complicated man.

150
00:08:27.341 --> 00:08:30.594
And the only one
that understands him is his woman.

151
00:08:30.844 --> 00:08:31.845
Seek therapy.

152
00:08:42.481 --> 00:08:44.233
- Woo woo!
- Narcos! Narcos!

153
00:08:52.783 --> 00:08:55.828
Let's see your hands!
See your hands, up against the wall!

154
00:08:56.286 --> 00:08:58.122
Put your hands up.

155
00:08:58.956 --> 00:09:00.666
- You ain't gotta push me.
- Hands up.

156
00:09:00.749 --> 00:09:02.167
Let me see you got your hands up.

157
00:09:02.251 --> 00:09:04.753
- Anything on you?
- Here he goes.

158
00:09:05.629 --> 00:09:07.631
Later, son. Step light.

159
00:09:11.301 --> 00:09:14.096
Yo, was that the stash? Fuck!

160
00:09:16.306 --> 00:09:18.600
Let's go, let's go!
Cut him off on stricker.

161
00:09:30.779 --> 00:09:33.240
I've got Calhoun. Where you at?

162
00:09:49.047 --> 00:09:51.508
Lost him. Rear of stricker, 800 block.

163
00:09:51.842 --> 00:09:52.968
Clear on riggs.

164
00:09:59.391 --> 00:10:02.853
He just went across stricker
in an alley headed for gilmor.

165
00:10:12.362 --> 00:10:13.572
Fuck.

166
00:10:13.697 --> 00:10:16.533
We got rabbit in the alleys near gilmor.
How about some backup?

167
00:10:16.784 --> 00:10:17.785
Roger that.

168
00:10:29.129 --> 00:10:31.840
Dozerman, what's your 20?
Hey, doze, where you at, man?

169
00:10:32.257 --> 00:10:34.885
- Did he cross stricker?
- Definitely.

170
00:10:35.052 --> 00:10:36.970
Everybody to lambeth.

171
00:10:42.726 --> 00:10:46.396
Who is the man that would risk his neck
for his brother man?

172
00:10:51.902 --> 00:10:54.112
He went to ground in this block, man.

173
00:11:00.828 --> 00:11:03.163
Hey, listen to me,
you little fucking piece of shit!

174
00:11:03.247 --> 00:11:05.582
I'm gonna tell you one thing only

175
00:11:05.666 --> 00:11:07.584
about the western
boys you are playing with!

176
00:11:08.710 --> 00:11:10.087
We do not lose!

177
00:11:11.255 --> 00:11:12.756
And we do not forget!

178
00:11:13.298 --> 00:11:14.967
And we do not give up!

179
00:11:15.384 --> 00:11:16.718
Even

180
00:11:17.135 --> 00:11:18.929
so I'm only gonna say this one time,

181
00:11:19.137 --> 00:11:21.807
if you march your ass out here right now

182
00:11:21.890 --> 00:11:23.517
and put the bracelets on,

183
00:11:23.600 --> 00:11:26.603
we will not kick the
living shit out of you!

184
00:11:27.396 --> 00:11:29.606
But if you make us go
into them weeds for you,

185
00:11:29.690 --> 00:11:33.193
or if you make us come back here
tomorrow night, catch you on a corner,

186
00:11:33.360 --> 00:11:35.195
I swear to fucking Christ,

187
00:11:35.279 --> 00:11:39.032
we will beat you longer and harder
than you beat your own dick!

188
00:11:42.494 --> 00:11:44.872
Cos you do not get to win, shitbird.

189
00:11:44.955 --> 00:11:46.164
We do!

190
00:11:57.134 --> 00:11:58.468
With these towers down,

191
00:11:58.552 --> 00:12:00.470
we need to take the rest of them low-rises

192
00:12:00.554 --> 00:12:01.994
and all them fayette street corners.

193
00:12:02.764 --> 00:12:04.099
Take them?

194
00:12:04.308 --> 00:12:06.768
Take them how, Mr. Bodie?

195
00:12:06.977 --> 00:12:09.497
- Say "fuck it" and take them.
- Nigger, you ain't got the floor.

196
00:12:09.521 --> 00:12:11.315
Chair don't recognize your ass.

197
00:12:11.440 --> 00:12:13.734
- Take them how?
- I don't know.

198
00:12:13.817 --> 00:12:17.905
Just let them fayette niggers know,
you know, we serious, right?

199
00:12:17.988 --> 00:12:19.156
You know, get or get got.

200
00:12:19.239 --> 00:12:21.909
Yeah, like you did
on mcculloh street last year?

201
00:12:21.992 --> 00:12:25.996
Snatch the real estate, load up, and
just wait for some shit to happen, right?

202
00:12:26.830 --> 00:12:31.668
No, man, we done worrying about territory,
man, what corner we got, what project.

203
00:12:31.877 --> 00:12:33.253
Game ain't about that no more.

204
00:12:33.337 --> 00:12:36.256
It's about product. Yeah.

205
00:12:37.799 --> 00:12:39.092
We got the best goddamn product,

206
00:12:39.176 --> 00:12:41.595
so we gonna sell
no matter where we are, right?

207
00:12:42.846 --> 00:12:45.974
Product, motherfuckers. Product.

208
00:12:47.476 --> 00:12:49.519
Chair recognize slim Charles.

209
00:12:50.562 --> 00:12:54.274
Chair, our people got to stand
somewhere, don't they?

210
00:12:54.358 --> 00:12:56.818
I mean, all the product in the world
don't mean nothing

211
00:12:56.902 --> 00:13:00.030
if you constantly get your ass whipped
for standing on another fool's corner.

212
00:13:00.614 --> 00:13:01.698
All right.

213
00:13:02.199 --> 00:13:04.785
We had six of the towers
on the terrace, right?

214
00:13:04.868 --> 00:13:06.244
All running 24/7.

215
00:13:06.328 --> 00:13:08.664
But three of those we gave to prop Joe

216
00:13:08.747 --> 00:13:11.667
to upgrade the package
that we was putting out there, right?

217
00:13:11.750 --> 00:13:13.752
Now, how much you
think we lost in the deal?

218
00:13:16.588 --> 00:13:18.715
All right, the answer is, we made more.

219
00:13:19.132 --> 00:13:21.635
Half the real estate, twice the product.

220
00:13:21.718 --> 00:13:23.929
And our profit went up
eight or nine per cent.

221
00:13:24.721 --> 00:13:27.474
Your territory ain't gonna mean shit
if your product is weak.

222
00:13:28.058 --> 00:13:31.436
Go ahead and ask them motherfuckers
trying to sell them Ford tempos,

223
00:13:31.520 --> 00:13:34.648
and you got niggers riding around in
Japanese and German cars in america.

224
00:13:35.440 --> 00:13:37.150
Territory ain't shit.

225
00:13:37.609 --> 00:13:41.279
Especially when you consider
it's the fight for the territory

226
00:13:41.363 --> 00:13:45.951
that be bringing the bodies,
and the bodies that bring the police.

227
00:13:46.034 --> 00:13:48.161
- Yeah, but how we gonna stand...
- Yo.

228
00:13:48.245 --> 00:13:50.372
Chair ain't recognize your ass, man.

229
00:13:54.251 --> 00:13:56.837
- How we gonna stand on some...
- Come on, man.

230
00:13:58.964 --> 00:14:01.425
How we gonna stand on some corner
that's not ours?

231
00:14:01.508 --> 00:14:03.635
Well, we got the best product.

232
00:14:03.719 --> 00:14:06.555
So the chances are, we'll be able
to bring in the competition

233
00:14:06.638 --> 00:14:09.599
by offering to re-up
with us from our package.

234
00:14:10.642 --> 00:14:12.019
Feel me?

235
00:14:12.102 --> 00:14:15.063
Everybody making money,
sharing the real estate.

236
00:14:15.272 --> 00:14:16.481
Slim Charles.

237
00:14:17.649 --> 00:14:19.289
What if they don't cop our re-up, though?

238
00:14:20.902 --> 00:14:23.989
I'm gonna worry about that when it happen.

239
00:14:24.114 --> 00:14:27.784
Until then, Mr. Charles,
we gonna handle this shit like businessmen.

240
00:14:28.326 --> 00:14:32.164
Sell the shit, make the profit,
and later for that gangster bullshit.

241
00:14:33.623 --> 00:14:35.542
Yeah.

242
00:14:35.625 --> 00:14:37.979
Do the chair know we gonna look
like punk-ass bitches out there?

243
00:14:38.003 --> 00:14:40.589
Motherfucker, I will punk your ass
for saying such shit!

244
00:14:40.672 --> 00:14:41.798
- String!
- What?

245
00:14:41.882 --> 00:14:43.818
- Poot did have the floor.
- Shut the fuck up, man.

246
00:14:43.842 --> 00:14:45.842
This nigger too ignorant
to have the fucking floor.

247
00:14:52.184 --> 00:14:55.024
Y'all niggers need to start looking
at the world in a new fucking light.

248
00:14:55.145 --> 00:14:58.190
Start thinking about this shit
like some grown fucking men,

249
00:14:58.607 --> 00:14:59.917
not some niggers off the fucking corner,

250
00:14:59.941 --> 00:15:01.651
you heard me?

251
00:15:05.655 --> 00:15:07.074
Adjourn your asses.

252
00:15:20.337 --> 00:15:21.755
Y'all look like shit.

253
00:15:21.838 --> 00:15:24.841
Well, we been stuck in that vacant
since before dawn.

254
00:15:24.925 --> 00:15:28.345
- How should we look?
- Proud to know you, detective.

255
00:15:30.806 --> 00:15:33.016
Mm.

256
00:15:35.435 --> 00:15:38.647
- Nice look on you.
- Dress for success.

257
00:15:41.608 --> 00:15:43.860
Oh, I watched that motherfucker cheese

258
00:15:43.944 --> 00:15:46.029
take re-ups, move weight all day,

259
00:15:46.113 --> 00:15:48.198
and not once did he go
near a fucking telephone.

260
00:15:48.490 --> 00:15:52.160
Closest it comes is a call
to a hanger-on's cellphone ten feet away.

261
00:15:52.244 --> 00:15:55.455
Which brings me to what I was just
discussing with the lieutenant.

262
00:15:55.914 --> 00:15:58.959
We've been up on these cellphones
for nearly six months.

263
00:15:59.042 --> 00:16:02.838
The only drug talk we have
is from street-level small fry.

264
00:16:03.130 --> 00:16:05.340
So, the feeling is that two weeks from now

265
00:16:05.423 --> 00:16:07.676
we don't go to the court
for another extension.

266
00:16:07.759 --> 00:16:10.637
We charge what we have,
try to roll someone up at cheese

267
00:16:10.720 --> 00:16:12.180
or one of Joe's other lieutenants.

268
00:16:12.264 --> 00:16:14.584
Who are you kidding?
We don't have a case worth making yet.

269
00:16:14.724 --> 00:16:16.059
And at this rate, we never will.

270
00:16:16.309 --> 00:16:19.729
- Oh, for Christ's sake.
- As a plan on paper, it was a good one.

271
00:16:19.813 --> 00:16:21.356
We came out of the port investigation

272
00:16:21.439 --> 00:16:25.235
with good phone numbers
for prop Joe's people.

273
00:16:25.569 --> 00:16:29.948
I guarantee if we can push this thing above
the street, we'll see prop Joe himself.

274
00:16:30.240 --> 00:16:32.075
We start seeing Joe, we'll see stringer.

275
00:16:32.159 --> 00:16:35.787
I can't ask for more time
on a wire that's going nowhere.

276
00:16:37.831 --> 00:16:40.959
Either we figure a way
to punch through the wall or we let it go.

277
00:16:43.086 --> 00:16:44.713
- Baker?
- Yes, sir.

278
00:16:44.796 --> 00:16:47.007
- So you must be castor.
- Yes, sir.

279
00:16:47.090 --> 00:16:49.968
- Officer Aaron castor.
- You any kin to Lloyd castor?

280
00:16:50.051 --> 00:16:52.929
- Yes, sir, that's my uncle.
- Good police.

281
00:16:56.975 --> 00:16:58.476
Do you know where you are?

282
00:16:59.436 --> 00:17:02.022
- You too. Where are you?
- The western, major.

283
00:17:02.105 --> 00:17:04.774
Right this very second,
you getting your hind parts kicked,

284
00:17:04.858 --> 00:17:06.568
and you screaming for help.

285
00:17:06.776 --> 00:17:10.697
Your backup's looking all over the place
cos he don't know where the fuck you are.

286
00:17:10.780 --> 00:17:13.700
And that means
I gotta explain to your next of kin

287
00:17:13.783 --> 00:17:16.661
how you went and got yourselves
killed on my watch.

288
00:17:16.953 --> 00:17:20.540
Sir, we're at 1034 north
mount, first floor rear.

289
00:17:20.624 --> 00:17:22.417
Good.

290
00:17:22.834 --> 00:17:24.628
Now, which way is north?

291
00:17:25.003 --> 00:17:26.504
Point.

292
00:17:29.341 --> 00:17:30.842
That's east.

293
00:17:32.844 --> 00:17:35.472
Now, if you're in foot pursuit

294
00:17:35.555 --> 00:17:38.225
it might help your backup to know
what direction you're running.

295
00:17:45.982 --> 00:17:48.777
Even numbers tell you north and west.

296
00:17:49.486 --> 00:17:50.820
Odds, south and east.

297
00:17:53.531 --> 00:17:54.950
Compasses.

298
00:17:55.033 --> 00:17:57.494
Until you learn that much, you carry one.

299
00:18:02.165 --> 00:18:04.167
Welcome to the western.

300
00:18:04.251 --> 00:18:06.461
Gentlemen, scuff yourself up a little.

301
00:18:06.836 --> 00:18:09.047
And learn the stare.

302
00:18:14.302 --> 00:18:15.553
Hey, carv, where you at?

303
00:18:15.679 --> 00:18:19.349
I'm at a desk outside the roll call room
on the first floor of 1034 north mount.

304
00:18:19.516 --> 00:18:22.227
My feet are facing west
and my dick is pointing south-southwest.

305
00:18:23.853 --> 00:18:26.853
Bunny Colvin's been giving that speech
as long as you guys been sucking air.

306
00:18:27.190 --> 00:18:30.944
Officer raybold, pick up 7a.
Officer raybold, line 7a.

307
00:18:31.027 --> 00:18:32.862
Where you at, shitbird?

308
00:18:32.946 --> 00:18:36.866
You're in handcuffs, in my house,
looking stupid, ain't you?

309
00:18:42.747 --> 00:18:45.333
Fleeing and eluding?

310
00:18:45.417 --> 00:18:46.835
Do we have a drug charge here?

311
00:18:47.085 --> 00:18:49.045
Loitering in a designated drug-free zone.

312
00:18:49.504 --> 00:18:51.548
Let me rephrase.
Do we have drugs?

313
00:18:51.881 --> 00:18:54.592
He raised up when we hit his corner
and grabbed this bag.

314
00:18:54.676 --> 00:18:57.387
- We pursued and recovered the bag.
- But no drugs.

315
00:18:57.721 --> 00:18:59.806
- And they whooped my ass.
- Western district way.

316
00:19:00.557 --> 00:19:01.725
So, what did we learn?

317
00:19:02.058 --> 00:19:06.229
Using half my district k-9 and the copter
to bring a 14-year-old to bay.

318
00:19:06.479 --> 00:19:09.065
- What did we learn?
- That you can't raise up and run

319
00:19:09.232 --> 00:19:13.695
from a drug corner in sector one
without my boot finding your ass.

320
00:19:14.070 --> 00:19:15.447
Right?

321
00:19:23.413 --> 00:19:25.707
I got it, I got it, I got it. Got it.

322
00:19:27.083 --> 00:19:28.793
Cast iron. 20 at least.

323
00:19:28.877 --> 00:19:32.672
- It'd be better if it was copper.
- Yeah, be better if it was gold.

324
00:19:32.756 --> 00:19:35.133
But you gotta take life as it goes along,
you know?

325
00:19:35.216 --> 00:19:36.760
Oh, shit, oh, shit.

326
00:19:42.849 --> 00:19:44.035
- What's wrong with you?
- Sorry.

327
00:19:44.059 --> 00:19:46.227
- You're past sorry.
- Come on, man, chill.

328
00:19:46.436 --> 00:19:49.606
- We don't need this, man.
- You think you fucked up now?

329
00:19:51.149 --> 00:19:54.069
- What's up?
- Look what they did to my ride.

330
00:19:56.696 --> 00:19:59.783
Well, do it or don't.
But I got some place to be.

331
00:20:04.245 --> 00:20:07.415
- Thank you for your kindness.
- Y'all got to pay something, anything.

332
00:20:07.499 --> 00:20:10.139
- There be a principle here.
- If we had a dime, you'd have a dime.

333
00:20:10.627 --> 00:20:13.107
We're a little insufficient.
We're on our way to the metal man.

334
00:20:13.380 --> 00:20:14.690
We'll come back and pay for everything.

335
00:20:14.714 --> 00:20:16.633
I promise you.

336
00:20:23.431 --> 00:20:24.516
Hey, hey.

337
00:20:24.599 --> 00:20:26.643
After the junk man,
we gotta roll past kmart.

338
00:20:28.061 --> 00:20:29.354
Definitely.

339
00:20:30.271 --> 00:20:31.832
One last question, commissioner.

340
00:20:31.856 --> 00:20:35.985
Looking back over the past months,
if I read the felony breakdowns correctly,

341
00:20:36.069 --> 00:20:40.407
you've seen an up-tick in shootings and
serious assaults in the eastern district.

342
00:20:40.490 --> 00:20:42.951
Can we assume
you're already addressing this?

343
00:20:43.993 --> 00:20:45.829
Let me throw that over to bill.

344
00:20:45.912 --> 00:20:50.542
As deputy for operations,
I'm sure he's got a handle on our response.

345
00:20:51.543 --> 00:20:53.336
I do indeed.

346
00:20:53.878 --> 00:20:55.505
In answer to your question, councilman,

347
00:20:56.172 --> 00:20:58.842
I can assure you that we've put
additional tactical teams

348
00:20:58.925 --> 00:21:01.719
on a seven to three shift
in every eastern sector.

349
00:21:02.053 --> 00:21:04.597
Additionally, we've put
the district flex squad

350
00:21:04.681 --> 00:21:06.766
on a seven to three shift,

351
00:21:06.850 --> 00:21:11.146
being as those are the hours when we're
seeing a spike in aggravated assaults.

352
00:21:11.271 --> 00:21:12.439
Thank you, deputy.

353
00:21:13.523 --> 00:21:16.693
Anything else for these, er,
esteemed constables?

354
00:21:18.278 --> 00:21:19.839
Ok, then, I guess I'll see you
all tomorrow night

355
00:21:19.863 --> 00:21:22.282
for the quarterly budget review.

356
00:21:30.540 --> 00:21:32.709
Erv... hey.

357
00:21:33.001 --> 00:21:35.187
If you don't mind, I'd like to
get with you about a couple things.

358
00:21:35.211 --> 00:21:36.254
Can we get lunch?

359
00:21:36.921 --> 00:21:39.090
Glad to, Mr. Chairman.

360
00:21:39.466 --> 00:21:42.886
- How about Werner's in a half-hour?
- Half-hour, good.

361
00:21:48.892 --> 00:21:51.060
- You see Watkins in the back?
- Yeah.

362
00:21:52.103 --> 00:21:53.688
Who was that skirt with him?

363
00:21:55.857 --> 00:21:57.817
That's him there in the orange?

364
00:21:57.901 --> 00:21:59.277
That's drac.

365
00:21:59.903 --> 00:22:02.530
Our last best hope.

366
00:22:02.739 --> 00:22:05.909
Talkingest motherfucker
I ever heard on a wiretap.

367
00:22:06.117 --> 00:22:08.745
- Here, listen.
- No, no, no, the other thing.

368
00:22:09.078 --> 00:22:10.638
The good... the other thing, my nigger.

369
00:22:10.747 --> 00:22:11.765
You talking him?

370
00:22:11.789 --> 00:22:14.209
No, her. I mean her!

371
00:22:16.169 --> 00:22:18.421
Cocaine, nigger, you feel me?
Goddamn, you ignorant...

372
00:22:18.630 --> 00:22:22.425
- You ever hear that on a wire?
- He doesn't report to anyone that matters.

373
00:22:22.759 --> 00:22:26.554
Right now, drac's re-ups
are with lavell mann.

374
00:22:27.180 --> 00:22:31.351
- He's got corners over on Preston and bond.
- He was pretty close to selling us weight.

375
00:22:31.434 --> 00:22:34.395
No shit. Sydnor's been working toward him
for a couple of months now.

376
00:22:34.479 --> 00:22:37.273
Lavell's a soldier.
He's not gonna roll up on prop Joe.

377
00:22:37.690 --> 00:22:38.691
That's true.

378
00:22:38.942 --> 00:22:43.279
But if we take him with a hand-to-hand,
they gotta promote someone to replace him.

379
00:22:43.571 --> 00:22:44.948
Yeah, why drac?

380
00:22:45.323 --> 00:22:48.284
- One thing about our boy?
- That's prop Joe's nephew.

381
00:22:48.952 --> 00:22:50.995
On his mama's side.

382
00:23:02.966 --> 00:23:05.301
20 and two.

383
00:23:07.804 --> 00:23:09.764
Y'all know you ain't got pants?

384
00:23:12.183 --> 00:23:14.477
And there's Dominic standing in line.

385
00:23:15.562 --> 00:23:17.802
When he meets the president,
who's looking the other way,

386
00:23:17.855 --> 00:23:19.816
Dominic reaches around Carter,

387
00:23:20.066 --> 00:23:23.528
- grabs his belt, yanks it up...
- Secret service must've shit.

388
00:23:23.611 --> 00:23:26.072
He says, "hey, Mr. President, remember me?"

389
00:23:26.155 --> 00:23:28.032
And Carter actually remembers.

390
00:23:28.116 --> 00:23:31.327
"Sure, Dominic dipietro from Baltimore,
on the campaign trail."

391
00:23:31.828 --> 00:23:34.789
And Dominic puts his finger
in Jimmy Carter's face and says,

392
00:23:34.872 --> 00:23:36.183
"where's that money you promised me

393
00:23:36.207 --> 00:23:38.209
"to fix up my streets?"

394
00:23:38.585 --> 00:23:40.003
- Unbelievable.
- That's nothing.

395
00:23:40.211 --> 00:23:43.756
After losing to Reagan,
Carter comes here to speak at a dinner

396
00:23:44.007 --> 00:23:45.425
and Dominic is ushered up to him.

397
00:23:45.758 --> 00:23:46.878
Carter asks about his health

398
00:23:46.926 --> 00:23:47.927
and Dominic says,

399
00:23:48.011 --> 00:23:49.137
"you son of a bitch,

400
00:23:49.345 --> 00:23:51.431
"I'm still waiting on
that money for my streets."

401
00:23:51.514 --> 00:23:53.516
- Come on!
- No shit.

402
00:23:53.600 --> 00:23:56.269
Carter's just grinning
through those big teeth.

403
00:23:56.352 --> 00:23:58.730
Some guy grabs Dominic's arm,
and off he goes.

404
00:23:58.813 --> 00:24:02.942
Guy says, "Christ, Dominic, you just called
the president of the United States an sob."

405
00:24:03.526 --> 00:24:04.611
He shrugs, he says,

406
00:24:04.694 --> 00:24:06.613
"fuck him. I don't need him. He lost."

407
00:24:08.865 --> 00:24:11.326
No, that's good. That is good.

408
00:24:13.786 --> 00:24:15.997
And that is from whence I come.

409
00:24:16.247 --> 00:24:19.083
Proud son of the fighting first district.

410
00:24:21.586 --> 00:24:24.380
But the truth is...

411
00:24:24.464 --> 00:24:27.383
I don't wanna be just another muldoon
like Dominic dipietro,

412
00:24:27.467 --> 00:24:29.302
warming the backbench.

413
00:24:29.385 --> 00:24:32.138
Not with the way things are
right now in the city.

414
00:24:32.221 --> 00:24:34.849
We're losing 10,000,
12,000 residents a year.

415
00:24:34.932 --> 00:24:36.702
And when you ask them why
they're moving to the county,

416
00:24:36.726 --> 00:24:37.769
know what they say?

417
00:24:38.144 --> 00:24:40.730
- Schools.
- And crime.

418
00:24:41.689 --> 00:24:43.483
Schools and crime.

419
00:24:43.566 --> 00:24:45.818
And there goes our tax base
right across the line,

420
00:24:45.902 --> 00:24:50.490
and the mayor's acting like a 10% bump
in the murder rate is business as usual.

421
00:24:50.948 --> 00:24:53.493
- Check, please.
- You know what?

422
00:24:54.243 --> 00:24:55.662
If you were smart,

423
00:24:55.745 --> 00:24:57.914
you'd come to me when the mayor
shorts you on hiring,

424
00:24:58.164 --> 00:25:00.708
on equipment, on overtime, on cars.

425
00:25:00.917 --> 00:25:02.502
You get the shit end of the stick,

426
00:25:02.627 --> 00:25:04.212
you come to me.

427
00:25:04.295 --> 00:25:07.048
Not publicly. I know you can't
cross the mayor publicly,

428
00:25:07.131 --> 00:25:08.841
but back-door, come to me,

429
00:25:08.925 --> 00:25:11.761
and I can use that subcommittee
to give you what you need.

430
00:25:12.595 --> 00:25:14.097
Thanks.

431
00:25:15.264 --> 00:25:16.265
Kind offer.

432
00:25:16.641 --> 00:25:19.018
Erv, I can help you.

433
00:25:19.102 --> 00:25:21.205
- And we can turn this damn city around...
- But long ago,

434
00:25:21.229 --> 00:25:24.107
when I was just starting out
in the department,

435
00:25:24.190 --> 00:25:27.151
I had the good fortune
to be taught a little something

436
00:25:27.235 --> 00:25:29.028
about chain of command.

437
00:25:29.570 --> 00:25:31.030
And right now,

438
00:25:31.114 --> 00:25:34.951
in my capacity as acting commissioner,

439
00:25:38.830 --> 00:25:40.957
I report to mayor Royce.

440
00:25:43.126 --> 00:25:46.254
I got your coffee.
Leave a tip if you want.

441
00:25:54.637 --> 00:25:55.948
So what do you need to see me for?

442
00:25:55.972 --> 00:25:58.224
- You getting out tomorrow, right?
- Yeah.

443
00:25:58.307 --> 00:26:00.601
Probably try and reach out.

444
00:26:00.685 --> 00:26:03.312
- What you gonna do first?
- Huh?

445
00:26:03.521 --> 00:26:05.314
Tomorrow. What you gonna do?

446
00:26:07.525 --> 00:26:09.068
I don't know.

447
00:26:09.152 --> 00:26:11.404
I know what be first.
You don't know?

448
00:26:11.487 --> 00:26:12.739
I know what be first.

449
00:26:12.822 --> 00:26:14.157
I'm going home.

450
00:26:15.658 --> 00:26:17.535
Time out!

451
00:26:31.048 --> 00:26:32.550
Backin!

452
00:26:33.801 --> 00:26:35.511
Watch the hole. Watch the hole.

453
00:26:38.347 --> 00:26:39.849
Short-timer.

454
00:26:41.017 --> 00:26:42.685
You only got the one day left, huh?

455
00:26:42.769 --> 00:26:44.997
- You done the one, just gotta do that other.
- All right.

456
00:26:45.021 --> 00:26:48.191
- Like they say.
- You only do two day.

457
00:26:48.274 --> 00:26:51.277
- There's the day you go in...
- The day you come out.

458
00:26:51.360 --> 00:26:53.529
I don't know. I did 14 years.

459
00:26:55.323 --> 00:26:58.618
Well, yeah, you know.
You did you a little stretch, true.

460
00:26:58.701 --> 00:27:01.412
But you still a soldier, right?

461
00:27:04.582 --> 00:27:06.959
You know them towers
done came down now, huh?

462
00:27:07.043 --> 00:27:10.129
The terrace, the Murphy homes.
All that shit gone, man.

463
00:27:10.213 --> 00:27:13.216
A lot of things is different now
since you been up in here.

464
00:27:13.382 --> 00:27:15.802
- Lot of changes.
- Yeah, no doubt.

465
00:27:16.052 --> 00:27:19.180
But, I mean, you know, shit.
Some things, they stay the same, man.

466
00:27:19.263 --> 00:27:21.265
I mean, the game's the game.

467
00:27:21.891 --> 00:27:24.268
And the thing is, since the towers is gone,

468
00:27:24.435 --> 00:27:26.497
I'm gonna need to take my thing
up to some new places.

469
00:27:26.521 --> 00:27:28.022
You feel me?

470
00:27:28.314 --> 00:27:29.774
You know I'm gonna be home

471
00:27:29.857 --> 00:27:31.192
soon enough, right?

472
00:27:31.526 --> 00:27:33.402
Yeah, first parole hearing, I'm out.

473
00:27:33.486 --> 00:27:36.197
For real. Shit is fixed right.

474
00:27:36.280 --> 00:27:38.074
I come home... huh.

475
00:27:39.242 --> 00:27:40.326
Shit!

476
00:27:40.409 --> 00:27:43.955
There's gonna be a little hell to be paid.
You know what I mean?

477
00:27:44.038 --> 00:27:46.749
A good soldier ain't gonna lack for work.

478
00:27:49.043 --> 00:27:50.336
Take that number, man.

479
00:27:50.837 --> 00:27:52.171
When you out, you call.

480
00:27:53.923 --> 00:27:56.092
We'll hook you up, no problem.

481
00:27:56.634 --> 00:27:58.678
You know, it's like a coming-home gift.

482
00:27:58.761 --> 00:28:01.222
All right?

483
00:28:01.889 --> 00:28:03.266
Call it.

484
00:28:06.769 --> 00:28:08.771
Dude, er_

485
00:28:09.188 --> 00:28:11.190
The joint might have broke him.

486
00:28:13.276 --> 00:28:17.363
Boss, you talking about a homie
who walked up and shot Elijah Davis.

487
00:28:17.446 --> 00:28:20.700
Broad daylight, at pennsie and gold.

488
00:28:21.576 --> 00:28:23.995
Then picked up the phone, dialled 911,

489
00:28:24.078 --> 00:28:26.998
told the police,
"I just shot a nigger, come get him."

490
00:28:28.291 --> 00:28:30.293
That dude ain't breaking.

491
00:28:31.335 --> 00:28:33.004
Nah.

492
00:28:36.757 --> 00:28:39.552
Look, we had the 20,
but we had to go buy some pants.

493
00:28:39.760 --> 00:28:43.389
If you take this short money,
we get back at you tomorrow.

494
00:28:43.472 --> 00:28:44.552
We get you on the comeback.

495
00:28:47.810 --> 00:28:49.145
Yo, he want two for 16.

496
00:28:49.270 --> 00:28:51.164
Trying to get two, man.
I'm trying to get two.

497
00:28:51.188 --> 00:28:53.983
From this young motherfucker.

498
00:28:54.650 --> 00:28:56.152
No.

499
00:28:56.319 --> 00:28:58.070
We a little short now,

500
00:28:58.154 --> 00:28:59.882
but tomorrow, I'll be
back here with the four.

501
00:28:59.906 --> 00:29:01.240
Joey said no.

502
00:29:01.324 --> 00:29:03.492
Spider bags and red tops!

503
00:29:04.619 --> 00:29:06.495
Fucking guy, man.

504
00:29:10.791 --> 00:29:14.879
At these prices,
I can't afford more phone surveillance.

505
00:29:15.504 --> 00:29:17.465
I'm aware of that.

506
00:29:17.548 --> 00:29:21.010
And right now, the plan is to go for
a hand-to-hand on one lieutenant

507
00:29:21.093 --> 00:29:25.598
- a couple rungs down from proposition Joe.
- And then roll the lieutenant up?

508
00:29:27.391 --> 00:29:29.810
We don't think he'll have much roll to him.

509
00:29:29.894 --> 00:29:32.021
Joe's people are pretty schooled.

510
00:29:32.104 --> 00:29:34.315
The hope is that they promote
this mid-level dealer

511
00:29:34.398 --> 00:29:37.234
who's a fool to replace him. Drac.

512
00:29:37.652 --> 00:29:38.694
We're on his cellphone.

513
00:29:38.986 --> 00:29:42.406
If he gets promoted, maybe he talks to Joe
or Joe's top people.

514
00:29:42.490 --> 00:29:43.491
We get that far,

515
00:29:43.574 --> 00:29:45.868
maybe we start to see stringer bell.

516
00:29:47.370 --> 00:29:50.706
What makes you think
they'll promote the wrong man?

517
00:29:52.541 --> 00:29:54.543
We do it all the time.

518
00:29:58.965 --> 00:30:03.344
Look, speaking of promotions,
I sent yours over to the hall, as promised.

519
00:30:03.427 --> 00:30:06.222
- And?
- And the mayor's holding it up.

520
00:30:06.305 --> 00:30:10.184
My understanding is he wants to know
what your wife is doing.

521
00:30:10.267 --> 00:30:11.268
My wife?

522
00:30:11.352 --> 00:30:14.772
Yeah. There's a rumor that she's
gonna take a run at a council seat.

523
00:30:14.855 --> 00:30:17.233
Maybe try to knock off eunetta Perkins.

524
00:30:18.234 --> 00:30:20.861
- That's my wife's business.
- Yes, it is.

525
00:30:21.362 --> 00:30:23.614
But the mayor counts eunetta as an ally.

526
00:30:23.698 --> 00:30:27.493
Our deal was for a permanent unit
and the next vacancy for major.

527
00:30:27.576 --> 00:30:31.664
You got your unit.
And I sent your name over to the hall.

528
00:30:31.747 --> 00:30:32.915
I kept my word.

529
00:30:35.126 --> 00:30:36.794
But the mayor,

530
00:30:36.877 --> 00:30:38.504
he may wanna know who his friends are

531
00:30:38.587 --> 00:30:40.881
before he makes a new commander.

532
00:30:44.927 --> 00:30:47.346
Where'd she say she was gonna be at?

533
00:30:47.430 --> 00:30:49.765
Near the dugout, first base side.

534
00:30:49.932 --> 00:30:50.975
She'll turn up.

535
00:30:51.058 --> 00:30:53.102
When is she supposed to
bring them over to you?

536
00:30:53.310 --> 00:30:55.062
Middle of the fourth.

537
00:30:56.063 --> 00:30:58.274
Dad, can I have a hot dog?

538
00:30:58.816 --> 00:31:00.860
Yeah, as soon as the guy comes around.

539
00:31:01.986 --> 00:31:04.572
Speaking of which, where's the beer man?

540
00:31:08.034 --> 00:31:09.827
Oh, there they are.

541
00:31:12.955 --> 00:31:16.167
- Look.
- Damn. They got great seats.

542
00:31:16.876 --> 00:31:18.085
Oh, hell.

543
00:31:19.462 --> 00:31:22.339
- What?
- Who's that on her left? The suit.

544
00:31:24.133 --> 00:31:27.303
- Just a friend?
- No, he's in the cake.

545
00:31:32.141 --> 00:31:35.644
Who comes to an orioles game in a suit,
spends half the time on a cellphone?

546
00:31:35.853 --> 00:31:38.105
Downtown lawyer.

547
00:31:38.189 --> 00:31:39.482
Something wealthy like that.

548
00:31:45.488 --> 00:31:49.200
- Wish we had more of it.
- Long way to go for half a shot.

549
00:31:51.243 --> 00:31:53.370
It'll be better tomorrow, bubs.

550
00:31:53.913 --> 00:31:55.831
Well...

551
00:31:56.290 --> 00:31:58.834
What kind of dope fiend
be talking about tomorrow?

552
00:31:58.918 --> 00:32:01.295
Tomorrow ain't shit.

553
00:32:01.837 --> 00:32:04.465
Today, Johnny. Today.

554
00:32:05.674 --> 00:32:09.512
I hunted down all that metal.
Lugged it around like a dog.

555
00:32:10.888 --> 00:32:15.684
I nearly get killed over a scratch of
metal, so that I gotta beg for my life.

556
00:32:16.936 --> 00:32:19.855
Lost my trousers, man, my fucking trousers.

557
00:32:20.689 --> 00:32:23.442
And then I'm begging again for half a shot?

558
00:32:26.904 --> 00:32:29.073
I swear to god, man, I'm not even high.

559
00:32:37.832 --> 00:32:39.917
- We just missed a foul, pa.
- Yeah?

560
00:32:40.459 --> 00:32:43.295
Our seats are great.
We're practically on the field.

561
00:32:43.379 --> 00:32:47.299
Yeah, my friend, Dennis,
he gets company seats every now and then.

562
00:32:47.383 --> 00:32:51.095
- Where are you sitting?
- Mezzanine. Come on.

563
00:32:51.178 --> 00:32:52.680
_ n - oh! 0, you guys go.

564
00:32:52.763 --> 00:32:54.932
Your dad hasn't seen you all week.

565
00:32:55.015 --> 00:32:58.477
Don't take theirjackets off,
cos Sean's just getting over a cold, ok?

566
00:32:58.561 --> 00:33:01.063
Jimmy, right? Dennis kerpelman.

567
00:33:02.565 --> 00:33:03.858
Great kids.

568
00:33:05.442 --> 00:33:06.902
Anyway, nice meeting you.

569
00:33:08.737 --> 00:33:12.449
- Do you want anything from the stand?
- No, thank you.

570
00:33:19.039 --> 00:33:22.084
Uh, don't stay till the last inning,
cos it's a school night.

571
00:33:24.753 --> 00:33:26.088
Bye.

572
00:33:38.893 --> 00:33:41.613
You got spatter going in two
different directions, just off the curb.

573
00:33:45.774 --> 00:33:47.943
- Yeah.
- Shooting on the West Side.

574
00:33:48.027 --> 00:33:50.196
Another one? Christ, where?

575
00:33:50.279 --> 00:33:52.031
North and pulaski, Cole's up.

576
00:33:52.573 --> 00:33:54.366
Cole's working a cutting off Belvedere.

577
00:33:54.450 --> 00:33:57.411
See if crutchfield's back
from the westport scene.

578
00:33:57.494 --> 00:33:58.829
If not, call bunk at home.

579
00:33:58.996 --> 00:34:01.290
- Bunk's off day.
- Hey, fuck his off day.

580
00:34:08.172 --> 00:34:10.007
I love this town.

581
00:34:16.555 --> 00:34:19.642
Perlozzo's pretty quick
to yank a pitcher, ain't he?

582
00:34:24.647 --> 00:34:26.398
I'm thinking of becoming a woman.

583
00:34:29.818 --> 00:34:32.196
Red-hot peanuts!

584
00:34:35.491 --> 00:34:37.409
Office. Yeah?

585
00:34:40.162 --> 00:34:41.914
I'm at the ball game.

586
00:34:41.997 --> 00:34:44.667
The ball game.

587
00:34:49.338 --> 00:34:51.507
Yeah, what about Cole? Call him.

588
00:34:53.384 --> 00:34:54.843
Oh, shit.

589
00:34:57.513 --> 00:34:58.597
All right.

590
00:35:02.351 --> 00:35:04.191
Can you believe this?
They caught five tonight.

591
00:35:04.270 --> 00:35:07.439
They're telling me to
come in on my day off.

592
00:35:07.523 --> 00:35:09.650
Five, huh?

593
00:35:09.733 --> 00:35:12.027
City's jumping bad, man.

594
00:35:14.029 --> 00:35:15.322
Ok, listen.

595
00:35:16.365 --> 00:35:18.367
- I gotta go to work, all right?
- All right.

596
00:35:20.577 --> 00:35:22.121
Mr. Jimmy's gonna...

597
00:35:22.204 --> 00:35:23.455
Ooh!

598
00:35:23.998 --> 00:35:26.000
He's gonna take you home.

599
00:35:28.002 --> 00:35:30.004
You're on your own, partner.

600
00:35:32.923 --> 00:35:36.760
Number 32... Luis matos.

601
00:36:32.858 --> 00:36:34.151
Hey, ma.

602
00:36:42.201 --> 00:36:44.953
- And erdman Avenue?
- No ballistic information.

603
00:36:46.121 --> 00:36:47.539
Are you sure?

604
00:36:48.999 --> 00:36:51.085
Take your time, major.

605
00:36:51.960 --> 00:36:55.589
Can you believe that cocksucker carcetti?
Thinking I'm gonna talk out of school.

606
00:36:55.964 --> 00:36:57.174
Any day now, Marvin.

607
00:36:57.800 --> 00:37:00.886
What can a white councilman give me
that a black mayor can't?

608
00:37:01.345 --> 00:37:02.471
No, you played it right.

609
00:37:02.888 --> 00:37:05.474
It was a .38 recorded
on erdman Avenue, sir.

610
00:37:05.766 --> 00:37:07.410
So what you are, in effect, saying, major,

611
00:37:07.434 --> 00:37:12.147
is rather than looking at this cluster of
robberies you had along monument street,

612
00:37:13.023 --> 00:37:15.651
you chose to investigate each
using separate personnel.

613
00:37:16.360 --> 00:37:19.029
No, sir, three of those cases
were commercial robberies,

614
00:37:19.154 --> 00:37:20.948
so we sent those downtown to cid.

615
00:37:21.031 --> 00:37:24.785
- My people had responsibility...
- God damn it, Marvin!

616
00:37:24.868 --> 00:37:27.704
Did you just invoke
the word "responsibility"

617
00:37:27.788 --> 00:37:29.957
to explain why you didn't
get on top of this shit?

618
00:37:30.374 --> 00:37:31.375
Did you just do that?

619
00:37:31.458 --> 00:37:33.335
I don't think you know
what the word means.

620
00:37:33.836 --> 00:37:36.422
When I look at the 24s and plainly see

621
00:37:37.005 --> 00:37:40.134
that some .38-caliber asshole
is raping your entire district

622
00:37:40.551 --> 00:37:44.012
all the way from greenmount
to fucking Edison highway.

623
00:37:44.680 --> 00:37:47.474
It's policing like that that makes it
possible for us to get hit

624
00:37:47.683 --> 00:37:51.270
with five fucking homicides
in a single fucking night, people!

625
00:37:52.312 --> 00:37:55.858
- Poor fucking Marvin.
- Better him than us, right?

626
00:37:56.358 --> 00:37:59.069
Based on your testimony,
the buy itself will be enough to charge,

627
00:37:59.153 --> 00:38:01.530
but get him saying something on tape,
it's even better.

628
00:38:01.947 --> 00:38:04.283
Are you sure this guy
wants to sell you weight?

629
00:38:04.366 --> 00:38:06.118
We don't wanna force this.

630
00:38:06.368 --> 00:38:09.705
- I been stroking this guy for two months.
- That's not what he asked you.

631
00:38:10.038 --> 00:38:12.124
This guy is ripe and ready, kima.

632
00:38:12.207 --> 00:38:13.584
It ain't no thing.

633
00:38:16.795 --> 00:38:18.380
They're about ready.

634
00:38:20.924 --> 00:38:23.510
You living out of the office, Cedric?

635
00:38:30.184 --> 00:38:32.686
All right, drac is depending on you people.

636
00:38:33.687 --> 00:38:34.771
Mount up.

637
00:38:40.569 --> 00:38:42.070
And find your way home.

638
00:38:49.995 --> 00:38:52.247
Look a little light to be an ounce,
don't you think?

639
00:38:52.331 --> 00:38:56.251
No, man. Ain't nothing
light, it's just settled, is all.

640
00:38:56.877 --> 00:39:00.964
If it does what it should, I'm gonna come
back to you for three, maybe four a week.

641
00:39:01.340 --> 00:39:02.716
Yeah, that could work.

642
00:39:03.008 --> 00:39:04.843
- We good, then?
- We good.

643
00:39:05.344 --> 00:39:06.762
- That's it.
- Take him down.

644
00:39:26.406 --> 00:39:28.367
- Somebody snitching!
- Shut the fuck up!

645
00:39:32.204 --> 00:39:33.455
Let's go, lavell.

646
00:39:47.594 --> 00:39:49.304
It's cutty.

647
00:39:49.721 --> 00:39:51.390
Was told I could call for help.

648
00:39:53.016 --> 00:39:57.604
What about the oxbow?
The oxbow on laurens, at fulton.

649
00:39:57.813 --> 00:39:58.897
All right.

650
00:40:01.567 --> 00:40:03.026
Damn.

651
00:40:08.991 --> 00:40:13.287
They caught lavell with a whole ounce.
Might not be no bail for that much weight.

652
00:40:13.370 --> 00:40:15.747
They might take it federal,
run wild on they ass.

653
00:40:15.831 --> 00:40:18.875
And Joey gotta give lavell's corner
to someone, right?

654
00:40:18.959 --> 00:40:20.043
Might be my turn.

655
00:40:20.127 --> 00:40:24.590
- Our boy won't shut up.
- Caroline, you say that like it's a bad thing.

656
00:40:25.090 --> 00:40:28.677
Let's just hope we're listening
to a candidate for elevation.

657
00:40:43.984 --> 00:40:47.738
I heard about you, man.
I hear your name used to ring out.

658
00:40:48.947 --> 00:40:50.866
You got something for me?

659
00:40:51.283 --> 00:40:53.201
You see where shorty's
sitting at right there?

660
00:40:53.910 --> 00:40:55.621
You'll find a little help.

661
00:40:55.704 --> 00:40:57.080
And when you ready,

662
00:40:57.164 --> 00:40:58.804
we got some real work for you, all right?

663
00:41:13.347 --> 00:41:15.349
Jesus!

664
00:41:30.030 --> 00:41:32.991
Hey. How you doing?

665
00:41:46.046 --> 00:41:48.757
- We were just talking about you.
- Really?

666
00:41:48.882 --> 00:41:50.550
You know Denise, from the sorority.

667
00:41:50.676 --> 00:41:53.261
- Charles, of course.
- Always a pleasure, lieutenant.

668
00:41:53.428 --> 00:41:57.099
- Good to see you.
- I don't think you've met delegate Watkins.

669
00:41:57.307 --> 00:41:59.434
- How do you do?
- Nice to meet you.

670
00:41:59.810 --> 00:42:02.145
We were saying
you fill out a lieutenant's uniform nicely.

671
00:42:03.021 --> 00:42:05.857
- Makes an impression on the campaign lit.
- That matters?

672
00:42:07.192 --> 00:42:09.986
Well, Marla's a new face
taking on a long-time incumbent.

673
00:42:10.237 --> 00:42:13.865
- Everything matters, I'm afraid.
- Well, anything I can do to help.

674
00:42:13.949 --> 00:42:17.035
I'll get out of the way
and leave you all to it.

675
00:42:21.998 --> 00:42:26.378
Marla, I have to tell you that your photo
with Cedric works really well on the mailer.

676
00:42:28.505 --> 00:42:30.173
I sure hope he knows what he's in for

677
00:42:30.257 --> 00:42:33.468
because it's gonna be
a long race for the both of you.

678
00:42:33.552 --> 00:42:36.930
- And that is not going to go easy.
- Speaking of which, we've got to...

679
00:42:45.021 --> 00:42:48.024
Jesus. Who called the media?

680
00:43:02.497 --> 00:43:05.560
No, you'd think the man might
respect my shit enough to let me step up.

681
00:43:05.584 --> 00:43:07.704
- But it ain't even go like that.
- Why not?

682
00:43:08.003 --> 00:43:10.764
He gonna give lavell's corner
to that off-brand nigger, cheese.

683
00:43:10.797 --> 00:43:12.841
Joe's my uncle.

684
00:43:13.175 --> 00:43:15.761
I mean, I'm kin to the fat motherfucker.

685
00:43:15.844 --> 00:43:19.222
That idiot works for us,
he'd be a deputy commissioner by now.

686
00:43:20.849 --> 00:43:22.609
Ain't no
luck at all to this case.

687
00:43:25.270 --> 00:43:29.065
How, in all good conscience, can I,
as chairman of this subcommittee,

688
00:43:29.149 --> 00:43:32.652
authorize any more overtime when
it's clear from the data in front of me

689
00:43:32.736 --> 00:43:36.573
that that money is not gonna go
to line officers, or working detectives,

690
00:43:36.656 --> 00:43:39.868
but is being used to pay for drivers
and clerical and...

691
00:43:40.744 --> 00:43:42.829
So that two colonels and three majors

692
00:43:42.913 --> 00:43:45.457
can attend a community
policing seminar in Miami.

693
00:43:45.791 --> 00:43:46.875
Mr. Chairman...

694
00:43:47.167 --> 00:43:49.294
What does south beach have
to teach this department

695
00:43:49.377 --> 00:43:51.171
about making Baltimore safer?

696
00:43:51.630 --> 00:43:55.467
I have no idea and you have no idea,
and it is an embarrassment.

697
00:43:58.970 --> 00:44:01.264
Cedric, they're gone.

698
00:44:13.068 --> 00:44:14.986
I wanna thank you for this.

699
00:44:15.070 --> 00:44:17.197
No problem.

700
00:44:17.280 --> 00:44:18.949
It's not easy, I know.

701
00:44:19.032 --> 00:44:22.285
But they seem to think it matters
that I present myself as...

702
00:44:22.369 --> 00:44:23.954
I'm fine with it.

703
00:44:25.080 --> 00:44:28.875
All those years
you were all about my career...

704
00:44:28.959 --> 00:44:31.294
Well, it's the least I can do, right?

705
00:44:35.257 --> 00:44:36.341
Good night.

706
00:44:43.139 --> 00:44:45.076
We're not holding
anything up in his district.

707
00:44:45.100 --> 00:44:49.187
Repaving, foot patrols, streetlights.

708
00:44:49.271 --> 00:44:51.106
He's getting his share.

709
00:44:52.107 --> 00:44:54.943
Unless it's not about his district...

710
00:44:56.653 --> 00:44:58.113
It's about him.

711
00:44:59.364 --> 00:45:01.950
Maybe he's got big eyes for something.

712
00:45:02.659 --> 00:45:04.452
For what?

713
00:45:04.619 --> 00:45:07.706
Not me, not my chair, not in this town.

714
00:45:07.789 --> 00:45:10.542
No. If that guy came off any whiter,
he'd be see-through.

715
00:45:11.459 --> 00:45:15.005
But if that's it, come on with it.
In fact, please, Jesus.

716
00:45:15.088 --> 00:45:18.800
Or maybe John the baptist.
Soften you up for someone else.

717
00:45:19.259 --> 00:45:22.721
- If he's gonna bang us on crime...
- Bang me on crime.

718
00:45:22.804 --> 00:45:26.057
Look, is there any way for you
to talk to this guy?

719
00:45:26.141 --> 00:45:28.059
Keep him from crawling up my ass?

720
00:45:28.143 --> 00:45:29.936
He's old first district.

721
00:45:30.186 --> 00:45:32.467
Not a lot of favors we can call in
over that side of town.

722
00:45:32.689 --> 00:45:37.277
- We've got to show him something, right?
- Four to five per cent drop in felonies.

723
00:45:37.360 --> 00:45:38.361
And murders.

724
00:45:39.029 --> 00:45:42.782
Get the murders down to
under 250 for the year.

725
00:45:42.866 --> 00:45:46.369
All due respect,
Mr. Mayor, we're at 232 now.

726
00:45:47.370 --> 00:45:48.997
What can you realistically do?

727
00:45:49.372 --> 00:45:52.876
Our best-case scenario,
if we bump overtime, is...

728
00:45:52.959 --> 00:45:54.836
275, maybe.

729
00:45:54.920 --> 00:45:58.465
- 275, Christ.
- That's a promise, right?

730
00:45:59.758 --> 00:46:00.759
275...

731
00:46:02.010 --> 00:46:04.387
And this asshole carcetti has no issue.

732
00:46:21.446 --> 00:46:26.034
Gentlemen, the word from on high
is that felony rates district by district

733
00:46:26.368 --> 00:46:29.621
will decline by five per cent
before the end of the year.

734
00:46:29.746 --> 00:46:30.946
We are dealing in certainties.

735
00:46:31.122 --> 00:46:34.876
You will reduce the ucr felonies
by five per cent or more, or...

736
00:46:35.502 --> 00:46:37.879
I've always wanted to say this...

737
00:46:37.963 --> 00:46:39.589
Let no man come back alive.

738
00:46:40.298 --> 00:46:44.386
In addition, we will hold
this year's murders to 275 or less.

739
00:46:44.469 --> 00:46:46.429
Christ.

740
00:46:46.554 --> 00:46:48.974
Feeling a little fazed, colonel foerster?

741
00:46:49.307 --> 00:46:51.142
A little dyspeptic?

742
00:46:51.226 --> 00:46:54.938
Dys-who? No, sir. I'm good to go.

743
00:46:57.524 --> 00:46:59.025
Here's a fun fact for you.

744
00:46:59.109 --> 00:47:00.986
If Baltimore had New York's population,

745
00:47:01.069 --> 00:47:03.363
we'd be clocking 4,000 murders
a year at this rate.

746
00:47:03.863 --> 00:47:07.492
There is no excuse I will accept.
I don't care how you do it.

747
00:47:07.575 --> 00:47:08.618
Just fucking do it.

748
00:47:08.702 --> 00:47:10.495
Er, deputy...

749
00:47:10.578 --> 00:47:14.082
As familiar as we all are
with the urban crime environment,

750
00:47:14.165 --> 00:47:17.919
I think we all understand
there are certain processes

751
00:47:18.003 --> 00:47:21.214
by which you can reduce
the number of overall felonies.

752
00:47:21.297 --> 00:47:24.884
You can reclassify an agg assault,
or you can unfound a robbery,

753
00:47:24.968 --> 00:47:27.429
but, er, how do you make a body disappear?

754
00:47:30.306 --> 00:47:34.102
There isn't one of you in this room
who isn't here by appointment.

755
00:47:34.185 --> 00:47:37.939
If you want to continue
wearing those oak clusters,

756
00:47:38.023 --> 00:47:40.525
you will shut up and step up.

757
00:47:40.608 --> 00:47:42.861
Any of you who can't bring in
the numbers we need,

758
00:47:42.944 --> 00:47:45.447
will be replaced by someone who can.

759
00:47:48.616 --> 00:47:50.410
That is all.

760
00:47:51.369 --> 00:47:52.954
Jesus, bunny.

761
00:47:53.288 --> 00:47:54.664
What got into you?

762
00:47:55.498 --> 00:47:57.083
Another six months to my 30.

763
00:47:57.167 --> 00:47:59.419
I'm out the door on a major's pension.

764
00:47:59.502 --> 00:48:00.962
The hell they could do to me.

765
00:48:05.300 --> 00:48:07.260
Spider bags, red tops.

766
00:48:36.164 --> 00:48:38.625
- Any other bright ideas?
- How about a bug?

767
00:48:38.958 --> 00:48:40.043
A bug?

768
00:48:40.126 --> 00:48:43.505
Yeah, bug one or two of the big corners
where these mopes hang.

769
00:48:43.588 --> 00:48:45.590
Watching those corners
over on Ashland yesterday,

770
00:48:45.673 --> 00:48:48.009
I'm seeing dumpsters, weeds,

771
00:48:48.093 --> 00:48:49.552
maybe a utility pole.

772
00:48:49.636 --> 00:48:52.180
You hide a bug in the right corner,
you make this case.

773
00:48:52.514 --> 00:48:55.475
We don't have the manpower.
Not to mention the money.

774
00:48:55.725 --> 00:48:59.020
And for what? We're still a
long way from a quality target.

775
00:48:59.104 --> 00:49:02.524
I say we come down off the wire,
charge what we can, and move on.

776
00:49:02.607 --> 00:49:05.819
We come down early two years ago,
we left a real bastard on the street.

777
00:49:05.902 --> 00:49:08.863
We're gonna let that same
son of a bitch beat me again?

778
00:49:09.531 --> 00:49:12.450
How many times do you let stringer bell
go around the board?

779
00:49:12.534 --> 00:49:14.702
Collect another fucking 200... million.

780
00:49:16.162 --> 00:49:19.749
- There's other fish in the barrel, mcnulty.
- Stringer's the target.

781
00:49:19.916 --> 00:49:23.962
There isn't a better fucker out there.
You know it, lieutenant.

782
00:49:28.383 --> 00:49:31.302
Don't you let him go soft on this.

783
00:49:31.386 --> 00:49:33.429
It's you against the world, is it?

784
00:49:39.477 --> 00:49:41.146
What the fuck did I do?

785
00:49:42.397 --> 00:49:44.065
Red tops, spider bags!

786
00:49:44.566 --> 00:49:46.234
You up?

787
00:49:56.995 --> 00:49:58.997
Step the fuck off, motherfucker.

788
00:49:59.622 --> 00:50:02.333
You got a need,
you talk to one of the young 'uns.

789
00:50:02.417 --> 00:50:04.210
I ain't in the market. I'm selling.

790
00:50:05.503 --> 00:50:08.006
You look like the right person
to be talking to, chief.

791
00:50:08.256 --> 00:50:10.925
You seem like you steady
running this shit here.

792
00:50:11.551 --> 00:50:14.179
What, are you some kind of
police or something?

793
00:50:14.262 --> 00:50:16.062
I'm a long motherfucking
way from the police.

794
00:50:16.639 --> 00:50:19.350
I just finished a 14-year bit in Jessup.

795
00:50:19.434 --> 00:50:22.562
Got a package as a coming-home present.

796
00:50:22.770 --> 00:50:25.440
- G-pack.
- Well, why not sell that shit your own self?

797
00:50:26.149 --> 00:50:29.444
I just came home.
I ain't trying to get my ass violated.

798
00:50:31.779 --> 00:50:32.780
Even split.

799
00:50:33.031 --> 00:50:37.452
- Shit. It's all profit to you.
- Risk mine, too.

800
00:50:37.535 --> 00:50:39.662
What make you think
I ain't on paper or some shit?

801
00:50:40.246 --> 00:50:41.456
60-40.

802
00:50:46.461 --> 00:50:49.339
Cool. Give your shit to my boy.

803
00:50:50.715 --> 00:50:52.383
He good with it.
Then come past tonight.

804
00:50:52.467 --> 00:50:53.801
All right.

805
00:50:56.596 --> 00:50:58.032
And one last item for you gents.

806
00:50:58.056 --> 00:51:01.809
It seems that foxtrot was hovering
over the station house a few days ago

807
00:51:01.976 --> 00:51:06.022
and caught a lovely view of about 700 or
800 discarded beer cans on the garage roof.

808
00:51:06.689 --> 00:51:09.692
Seriously, no off-duty drinking
on the station lot.

809
00:51:10.318 --> 00:51:12.278
And if you do find yourself
holding a beer can,

810
00:51:12.362 --> 00:51:15.949
don't throw it on the roof,
take it home with you.

811
00:51:16.032 --> 00:51:19.661
Come on, guys, the memo came down
from our beloved deputy of operations.

812
00:51:21.246 --> 00:51:23.164
All right, get out of here.

813
00:51:24.540 --> 00:51:26.292
Don't get captured.

814
00:51:30.672 --> 00:51:31.965
At ease.

815
00:51:34.467 --> 00:51:37.595
- Anything from day shift?
- Nothing that'll make the papers.

816
00:51:37.679 --> 00:51:40.890
I'm gonna ride the district
until the deputy major gets in.

817
00:51:40.974 --> 00:51:43.685
If you need me, hit the radio.

818
00:51:45.520 --> 00:51:46.854
Distribution?

819
00:51:48.314 --> 00:51:49.732
Possession.

820
00:51:50.149 --> 00:51:53.194
- And some loitering.
- Loitering?

821
00:51:53.403 --> 00:51:56.531
And behaving like assholes
in the presence of sworn officers, boss.

822
00:52:13.256 --> 00:52:15.591
- Hey.
- Hey, what's up?

823
00:52:16.050 --> 00:52:17.510
What's going on?

824
00:52:17.802 --> 00:52:19.137
Yeah, what's up, dawg?

825
00:53:09.771 --> 00:53:11.773
Five-0 creeping.

826
00:53:22.867 --> 00:53:26.621
It's midnight relief coming in.

827
00:53:53.981 --> 00:53:55.483
What the hell is all this?

828
00:53:57.819 --> 00:54:00.571
You don't look at what you did before,
you do the same shit all over.

829
00:54:02.323 --> 00:54:04.033
I'm out of here.

830
00:54:49.370 --> 00:54:52.039
Spiders with a red top! One and one!

831
00:54:56.878 --> 00:54:58.713
Where he at?

832
00:55:10.141 --> 00:55:12.935
Spider bags! Got those spider bags!

833
00:55:21.402 --> 00:55:23.654
The fuck you looking at?

834
00:55:26.741 --> 00:55:29.660
- What, do you want a go?
- Just my split.

835
00:55:30.786 --> 00:55:32.497
Some bad luck there.

836
00:55:33.122 --> 00:55:36.584
The police came through,
snatched up a ground stash or two.

837
00:55:36.709 --> 00:55:38.127
Shit happened to be yours.

838
00:55:38.836 --> 00:55:40.087
Fuck, right?

839
00:55:40.880 --> 00:55:43.299
- You got a number?
- A number?

840
00:55:43.674 --> 00:55:47.553
Back in the day, when a player tried to say
he lost a package to the police,

841
00:55:47.720 --> 00:55:50.139
he had to give up a number for the report.

842
00:55:50.973 --> 00:55:52.266
Well, we ain't back in the day.

843
00:55:54.018 --> 00:55:56.103
I'm getting fucking tired of your ass.

844
00:56:08.407 --> 00:56:10.451
Yeah, walk it off, motherfucker.

845
